## Slice

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/slice.html


```{R}
mtcars

library(tidyverse)
slice(mtcars,1L)

slice(mtcars,n())

```


Group_by just group row with same values (w.r.t a certain column) together. It does not reduce row number. 

## Group_by

```{R}
by_cyl<-group_by(mtcars,cyl)

by_cyl

nrow(mtcars)
nrow(by_cyl)

```


## Filter

You can also use __filter__ to do the same job as __slice__ . The only difference is that you need to provide a variable name. 

```{R}

filter(mtcars, row_number()==1L)

filter(mtcars, row_number()==n())
```
